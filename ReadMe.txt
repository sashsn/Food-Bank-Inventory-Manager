GROUP-49 
Final Project
ENSF 409

The Main function of the program is in GUI.java

The SQL access information is hardcoded into the program in 3 instances, all the instances are listed below - 

Algorithm.java - Line 51
Inventory.java - Line 72
SingleClient.java - Line 33


The program is ran by executing the main function from GUI and after taking order of (possibly) multiple hampers, when the order is finished, 
it creates an orderform with a hashed randomly generated number, the name of the orderfrom being "orderform-(order number)"

All the required source codes and .class files are included in the zipped submission along with the UML diagram and the video demonstration.

Running code:
javac -cp .;lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar edu/ucalgary/ensf409/*.java
java -cp .;lib/mysql-connector-java-8.0.23.jar edu/ucalgary/ensf409/GUI
